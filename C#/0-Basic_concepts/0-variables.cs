/*
** Just like C, C# has typed variables and every line must end with ";".
** The C# types are:
	int: integer.
	float: floating point number.
	double: double-precision version of float.
	char: a single character.
	bool: can only be true or false.
	string: a sequence of characters.
** Remember that char uses single quotes and string uses double quotes.
