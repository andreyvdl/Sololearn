//Comments are ways to explain you code for others, you probabbly see me using them a lot in this repository.
//There a two ways to comment, using "/* and //", if you use "/*" this will be a start point, you will need to use a "*/" to define a end point, because it will determinate that anything between the start point and end point will be a comment, but if you use "//" you are saying that all the line after this double slash will be a coment.
