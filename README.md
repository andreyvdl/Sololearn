# Sololearn
Sololearn is a website and app for learning to program.

If my explaining is hard to understand then I recommend you to run the code on your dev platform or on a debugger like [pythontutor](http://pythontutor.com). Remember, I'm just a student.

Let me know if you find any typo error, english isn't my mother language.
