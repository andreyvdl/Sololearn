<!--
DOM means Document Object Model;
it's what the browser builds when you open any webpage;
the DOM looks like a tree, on the top you have Document, that connect with <html>, that connect with <head> and <body>, then the <head> connect with <title>, and the <body> connect with <h1> and <a>;
so we can say they are basically the indentation, inside the document we have <html>, inside we have <head> and <body>, and goes on;
-->
<!doctype html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>DOM (not the one with demons)</title>
		<meta charset="UTF-8">
	</head>
	<body>
		<script>
			/*
			we changed the content of the document, on the tag body, that is an innerhtml element;
			innerHTML let us change almost all HTML elements;
			*/
			document.body.innerHTML = "Some text";
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
