				Every HTML code start with the opening and closing tag "<strong>html, /html</strong>";<br>
				They are like the buns of a hamburger, you can't make one with it.
			<p>
				After that we have the opening and closing tag "<strong>head, /head</strong>";<br>
				On the head tag we put non-visual elements.
			<p>
				The next is the opening and closing tag "<strong>body, /body</strong>";<br>
				This is where the page in self is, headings, paragraphs, lists, links, buttons, images, inputs and etc.
