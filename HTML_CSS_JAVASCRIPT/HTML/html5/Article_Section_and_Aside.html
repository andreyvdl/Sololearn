			The "article, /article" tag creates a container just like a "div";<br>
			The "section, /section" tag creates containers too, but in this case they need to be identified, normally by a heading;<br>
			The "aside, /aside" tag can creat a container too, but is normally used on sidebars, it should be specifically to the article.
