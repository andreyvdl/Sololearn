			This paragraph has an image that is floated to the <strong>right.</strong> 
			It is highly recommended to add a margin to images so that the text does 
			not get too close to the image. If you want your text to be easily read, you 
			should always add a few pixels between words and borders, images, 
			and other content.

		This paragraph is above the div element
